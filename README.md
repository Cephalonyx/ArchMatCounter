## Menu

### Edit Mode

I have included an Edit mode, to edit the number of materials for any row (in case you want to track all mats, including the ones you already have).  Uncheck the edit mode checkbox to save the changes.

Be sure to Click "Start" to once again track materials, as it will be disabled while editing.

### Filter Mats

Enabling this will show only materials with a quantity greater than 0.  This is useful if you want to only see mats that you are currently getting.

### Select Chat
When opening the app, it will detect all visible chat windows.  You can use this option to have the app target a specific window (The default is the window closest to the top-left of the screen).  When selecting a different window, a white box will surround the selected chat window briefly to show which chat you have seleted.
