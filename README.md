### Material Information

If you mouse over each material name, it will show a small popup showing the level that it can be accessed at, as well as where you can obtain those materials.

I have included an Edit mode, to edit the number of materials for any row (in case you want to track all mats, including the ones you already have).  Uncheck the edit mode checkbox to save the changes.

Be sure to Click "Start" to once again track materials, as it will be disabled while editing.
