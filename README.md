Tracks Archaeology Materials gained via the chat window.

Keeps data until you hit the "Clear" button.

## Instructions:
    1. Open app with RuneScape window visible.

    2. Ensure that the chat filter is off.  This ensures that all material messages are visible.
    
    3. Gather materials.  This will catch all material messages (I do not have the level to test for the autosifter).

The app will automatically start tracking as soon as it is opened.

The table will auto-populate and keep track of the materials that you have received.

Click "Stop" to stop tracking.

## Material locations

If you mouse over each material name, it will show a small popup showing where you can obtain those materials.

### Edit Mode

I have included an Edit mode, to edit the number of materials for any row (in case you want to track all mats, including the ones you already have).  Uncheck the edit mode checkbox to save the changes.

Be sure to Click "Start" to once again track materials, as it will be disabled while editing.


### Action Counter
- This will track how many times materials were added to the list.

### Export to CSV
- Clicking this will generate a CSV file with your current material stats.
